      "question": " Which of the following functions cannot be frequency response of a discrete-time LTI system? ",

        "a": "$H(\\omega) = \\sin(\\omega) $",

      "question": "The signal $x[n] = 1 + \\sin(n) + \\sin(\\pi n)$ is given as input to a low pass filter with cut-off frequency of 2. Select the correct statement from the following: ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Both $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ are periodic ",

        "d": " Neither $x[n]$ or $y[n]$ are periodic "
      },
      "explanations": {
        "Explanation": "The discrete-time signal $\\sin(n)$ is not a periodic signal. The output of low pass filter would be $y[n] = 1 + \\sin(n)$. Since both input and output contain the signal $\\sin(n)$, neither are periodic signals. "
